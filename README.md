# pandas-challenge-
In this challanege, we used Panda DataFrames to analyze data involving schools and standardized test scores. We meaured data involving the district and schools.

For the District we looked at: 
  Total number of unique schools
  Total students
  Total budget
  Average math score
  Average reading score
  % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
  % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
  % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

For the School we looked at:
  School name
  School type
  Total students
  Total school budget
  Per student budget
  Average math score
  Average reading score
  % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
  % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
  % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

We looked at the highest and lowest performing schools by the % overall passing.
We looked at the math and reading scored by grade.
We looked at scored by school spending, size, and type.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The conclusions that we can draw are that the percent of reading was higher than the percent of passing. We saw that charter schools showed higher overall passing scores than district schools. We also did not see much of a grade change along the years in reading or math.
